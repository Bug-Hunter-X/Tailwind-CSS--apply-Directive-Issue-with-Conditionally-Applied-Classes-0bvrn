To fix this, avoid using `@apply` within classes that are conditionally applied.  Instead, use regular Tailwind utility classes directly or create a dedicated class for the styles outside the conditional logic.

For example, instead of:

```html
<div :class="{'active': isActive}">
  <p class="@apply text-blue-500">Some text</p>
</div>
```

Use this:

```html
<div :class="{'active': isActive}">
  <p class="text-blue-500">Some text</p> <p class="active:text-red-500">Some more text</p>
</div>
```

Or, create separate classes and apply them accordingly:

```html
<div :class="{'active': isActive, 'my-custom-class': isActive}">
  <p>Some text</p>
</div>

<style>
.my-custom-class {
  @apply text-blue-500;
}
</style>
```
This will ensure that the styles are always included in the CSS output, resolving the issue.
