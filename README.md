# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Issue with Conditionally Applied Classes

This repository demonstrates a problem with Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive when used within conditionally applied classes. The `@apply` directive does not work correctly if the containing class is not present during the build time, leading to missing styles in the final output. 

## Problem Description
The issue occurs when a class containing `@apply` is conditionally rendered or applied based on JavaScript variables or dynamic state changes. If the class isn't present during the Tailwind build step, the `@apply` styles are not included, even if the class becomes active later during runtime.

## Solution
The recommended solution is to avoid using `@apply` within conditionally applied classes. Instead, utilize regular Tailwind utility classes directly or create a separate class with the desired styles. This ensures that the styles are always included in the generated CSS, irrespective of their conditional application.
